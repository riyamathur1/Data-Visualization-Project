# Police Shootings Visualization Project

## Project Description
This project is motivated by a commitment to social justice and the need to scrutinize law enforcement practices across the United States. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset that records police shootings since 2015, this analysis aims to illuminate the dynamics and trends within these incidents. By delving into the data, the project seeks to contribute to informed public discourse, providing a data-driven foundation to understand the scope and nature of police-involved shootings.
